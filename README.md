## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year student majoring in Computer Science, currently studying at Pertamina University, Indonesia. I really enjoy learning computer science and creating projects based on what I learn. So far, I've worked on a few simple projects, such as developing the frontend of the TicMov Mobile App (an online cinema ticket purchasing service with seat reservation capabilities) and the Tra-tour Mobile App (an application that assists communities in waste sorting and schedules waste collection in a more efficient and environmentally friendly way). The Tra-tour app won a national-level competition, PROXOCORIS 2024, organized by Universitas Klabat, in the category of Best Code Implementation.
